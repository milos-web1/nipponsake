Mountain rice utilizes cold, run-off water from the mountain and receives less sunlight.  In contrast, rice grown in the plains has more sunlight, and water comes from ponds and rivers.  The differences in these conditions result in different characteristics in the rice, which is why you can\u2019t simply group rice by strain.  Miyoshino has farm-direct contracts with each farmer to understand the rice and how it is grown, so the toji can apply the best brewing techniques to each type of rice.  This application of techniques goes for the rice polishing, where the toji chooses polishing rate by rice field, not by variety, to finding the right moto technique to bring out the best expressions of the rice."

The use of natural yeasts and bacteria is just a further extension of the \u201cterrior\u201d concept that uses local rice and the natural environment in a harmonious way to produce a sake the represents the essence of the Kii Peninsula."

The brewery goes to great lengths to impart some of this mythology into their brewing formula. They use Saka Nishiki rice, which takes its name from the shrine and is grown exclusively in Shimane Prefecture and source their water from the nearby Kitayama mountain range, another spiritual power spot.
